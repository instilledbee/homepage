**Notice: This is a repository for an old version of instilledbee.net. I'll try to upload a repo of the new website once I clean up the code.**

about
========

Old Markup/JS code for instilledbee.net's "mini-portfolio" homepage. Built from scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. Uses code from Sticky-Kit (http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/) and Google Web Fonts

files
========

index.html is the main markup file, while main.css and main.js contain the stylesheets and script, respectively, for the main page. 

projects.json is a listing of the project data loaded dynamically on the page. Each project should have a title, project URL, preview image URL, and a description (HTML allowed).
Images for projects are recommended to be 180x180 for optimal layout appearance.
